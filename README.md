## Basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

### Key Concepts

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning:** A type of machine learning using neural networks with many layers, particularly effective for image and speech recognition.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques that allow computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision:** Enabling machines to interpret and process visual information from the world.

### Applications

- Image and speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Recommendation systems
- Virtual assistants
- Medical diagnosis

AI continues to evolve rapidly, impacting various industries and transforming the way
